# Bio

I am robotics software engineer mainly interested in perception, navigation, localization and mapping.
My background is in optimization, state estimation, and SLAM and I have interest in programming applied mathematical algorithms that use optimization, probability, control theory, and numerical methods.
I hope to share some of my passion with the world in this blog.

# About this blog
In a nutshell, this blog is an experiment of sharing my notes and thoughts.
I will sometimes use it to as a more thorough `README.md` for software projects that I work on.

I enjoy reading technical papers and books on robotics and programming.
Part of my reading process is taking some notes, but they are usually jotted notes and not thorough enough.
So, maybe, writing my notes on a blog will force me to write more thorough notes.

Feel free to reach out to me if you find a mistake or some issue on the blog.
Happy reading!
