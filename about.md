# Bio

I am robotics software engineer at [Avidbots](https://www.avidbots.com), where I work with the localization and mapping team.
My background is in optimization, state estimation, and SLAM.
I have interest in programming applied mathematical algorithms that use optimization, probability, control theory, and numerical methods.
I hope to share some of my passion with the world in this blog.

# About this blog
In a nutshell, this blog is an experiment of sharing my notes and thoughts.


I enjoy reading and learning about new and old concepts, whether it's a topic in math or a bit of programming.
It's quite frustrating to learn a topic only to forget it few months later.
So, a while back, I decided to take more thorough notes whenever I'm learning a new topic.
Though I personally find these notes useful, they are not usually shared.
So I thought of sharing some of these notes on this blog.
