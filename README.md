# Overview
My personal website built using [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl) and the theme inherited from [tlienart.github.io](https://github.com/tlienart/tlienart.github.io).

# Usage
When testing the website locally, make sure the Julia Pluto notebooks are converted into HTML and stored under `notebooks/html` before inserting them into posts.
