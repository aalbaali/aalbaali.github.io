    In a nutshell, this blog is an experiment of sharing my notes and thoughts.

    I enjoy reading and learning about new and old concepts, whether it's a topic in math or a bit of programming. It's quite frustrating to learn a topic only to forget it few months later. So, a while back, I decided to take more thorough notes whenever I'm learning a new topic. Though I personally find these notes useful, they are not usually shared. So I thought of sharing some of these notes on this blog.
