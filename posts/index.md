  The posts presented on this website are mainly related to mathematics, robotics, coding, and other related subjects.
  As such, I opted to choose [Julia](https://julialang.org/) as the programming choice.
  This choice allows me to use [Pluto Notebooks](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), which allow easier flow of information and allow you to download the notebook and try it out for yourself!
  Enjoy!
